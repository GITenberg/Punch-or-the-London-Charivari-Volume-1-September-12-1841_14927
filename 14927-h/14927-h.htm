<p><span class="hide">A</span>fter the ceremony, the happy pair set
off for Brighton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is something peculiarly pleasing in the above paragraph.
The imagination instantly conjures up an elegant yellow-bodied
chariot, lined with pearl drab, and a sandwich basket. In one
corner sits a fair and blushing creature partially arrayed in the
garments of a bride, their spotless character diversified with some
few articles of a darker hue, resembling, in fact, the liquid
matrimony of port and sherry; her delicate hands have been denuded
of their gloves, exhibiting to the world the glittering emblem of
her endless hopes. In the other, a smiling piece of four-and-twenty
humanity is reclining, gazing upon the beautiful treasure, which
has that morning cost him about six pounds five shillings, in the
shape of licence and fees. He too has deprived himself of the
sunniest portions of his wardrobe, and has softened the glare of
his white ducks, and the gloss of his blue coat, by the application
of a drab waistcoat. But why indulge in speculative dreams when we
have realities to detail!</p>
<p>Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite and his beauteous Juliana
Theresa (late Waddledot), for three days, experienced
that&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Love is heaven, and heaven is love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>His imaginary dinner-party became a reality, and the delicate
attentions which he paid to his invisible guest rendered his
Juliana Theresa&rsquo;s life&mdash;as she exquisitely expressed
it&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;A something without a name, but to which nothing was
wanting.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But even honey will cloy; and that sweetest of all moons, the
Apian one, would sometimes be better for a change. Juliana passed
the greater portion of the day on the sofa, in the companionship of
that aromatic author, Sir Edward; or sauntered (listlessly hanging
on Collumpsion&rsquo;s arm) up and down the Steine, or the no less
diversified Chain-pier. Agamemnon felt that at home at least he
ought to be happy, and, therefore, he hung his legs over the
balcony and whistled or warbled (he had a remarkably fine D)
Moore&rsquo;s ballad of&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, if all those endearing young
charms;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or took the silver out of the left-hand pocket of his trousers,
and placed it in the right-hand receptacle of the same garment.
Nevertheless, he was continually detecting himself yawning or
dozing, as though &ldquo;the idol of his existence&rdquo; was a
chimera, and not Mrs. Applebite.</p>
<p>The time at length arrived for their return to town, and, to
judge from the pleasure depicted in the countenances of the happy
pair, the contemplated intrusion of the world on their family
circle was anything but disagreeable. Old John, under the able
generalship of Mrs. Waddledot, had made every requisite preparation
for their reception. Enamelled cards, superscribed with the names
of Mr. and Mrs. Applebite, and united together with a silver cord
tied in a true lover&rsquo;s knot, had been duly enclosed in an
envelope of lace-work, secured with a silver dove, flying away with
a square piece of silver toast. In company with a very
unsatisfactory bit of exceedingly rich cake, this glossy missive
was despatched to the whole of the Applebite and Waddledot
connexion, only excepting the eighteen daughters who Mrs. Waddledot
had reason to believe would not return her visit.</p>
<p>The meeting of the young wife and the wife&rsquo;s mother was
touching in the extreme. They rushed into each other&rsquo;s arms,
and indulged in plentiful showers of &ldquo;nature&rsquo;s
dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome! welcome <em>home</em>, my dear Juliana!&rdquo;
exclaimed the doting mother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time, Mr.
A., that she ever left me since she was 16, for so long a period. I
have had all the beds aired, and all the chairs uncovered.
She&rsquo;ll be a treasure to you, Mr. A., for a more tractable
creature was never vaccinated;&rdquo; and here the mother overcame
the orator, and she wept again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; said Agamemnon, &ldquo;I have
already had many reasons to be grateful for my happy fortune.
Don&rsquo;t you think she is browner than when we left
town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much, much!&rdquo; sobbed the mother; &ldquo;but the
change is for the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, for Aggy is of the same
opinion,&rdquo; lisped the beautiful ex-Waddledot. &ldquo;Tell
ma&rsquo; the pretty metaphor you indulged in yesterday,
Aggy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I merely remarked,&rdquo; replied Collumpsion,
blushing, &ldquo;that I was pleased to see the horticultural
beauties of her cheek superseded by such an exquisite marine
painting. It&rsquo;s nothing of itself, but Juley&rsquo;s foolish
fondness called it witty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of the single sister of Mrs. Applebite, occasioned
another rush of bodies and several gushes of tears; then titterings
succeeded, and then a simultaneous burst of laughter, and a rapid
exit. Agamemnon looked round that room which he had furnished in
his bachelorhood. A thousand old associations sprung up in his
mind, and a vague feeling of anticipated evil for a moment
oppressed him. The <em>bijouterie</em> seemed to reproach him with
unkindness for having placed a mistress over them, and the easy
chair heaved as though with suppressed emotion, at the thought that
its luxurious proportions had lost their charms. Collumpsion held a
mental toss-up whether he repented of the change in his condition;
and, as faithful historians, we are compelled to state that it was
only the entrance, at that particular moment, of Juliana, that
induced him to cry&mdash;woman.</p>
<p>On the following day the knocker of No. 24 disturbed all the
other numerals in Pleasant-terrace; and Mr. and Mrs. A. bowed and
curtsied until they were tired, in acknowledgment of their
friends&rsquo; &ldquo;wishes of joy,&rdquo; and, as one unlucky old
gentleman expressed himself, &ldquo;many happy returns of the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a matter of surprise to many of the said friends, that so
great an alteration as was perceptible in the happy pair, should
have occurred in such a very short space of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think Mr. Applebite a very nice young
man,&rdquo; said <em>Miss</em>&mdash;mind, Miss
Scragbury&mdash;&ldquo;but, dear me, how he&rsquo;s
altered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Applebite used to be a pretty girl,&rdquo;
rejoined her brother Julius; &ldquo;but now (Juliana had refused
him three times)&mdash;but now she&rsquo;s as ill-looking as her
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea this house was so small,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Scragmore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the Waddledots
haven&rsquo;t made so great a catch, after all. I hope poor Juley
will be happy, for I nursed her when a baby, but I never saw such
an ugly pattern for a stair-carpet in my born days;&rdquo; and with
these favourable impressions of their dear friends the Applebites,
the Scragmores descended the steps of No. 24, Pleasant-terrace, and
then ascended those of No. 5436 hackney-coach.</p>
<p>About ten months after their union, Collumpsion was observed to
have a more jaunty step and smiling countenance, which&mdash;as his
matrimonial felicity had been so frequently pronounced
perfect&mdash;puzzled his friends amazingly. Indeed, some were led
to conjecture, that his love for Juliana Theresa was not of the
positive character that he asserted it to be; for when any
inquiries were made after her health, his answer had invariably
been, of late, &ldquo;Why, Mrs. A.&mdash;is&mdash;not very
well;&rdquo; and a smile would play about his mouth, as though he
had a delightful vision of a widower-hood. The mystery was at
length solved, by the exhibition of sundry articles of a
Lilliputian wardrobe, followed by an announcement in the
<em>Morning Post</em>, under the head of</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;BIRTHS.&mdash;Yesterday morning, the lady of
Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite, Esq., of a son and
heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleasant-terrace was <em>strawed</em> from one end to the other;
the knocker of 24 was encased in white kid, a doctor&rsquo;s boy
was observed to call three times a-day, and a pot-boy twice as
often.</p>
<p>Collumpsion was in a seventh heaven of wedded bliss. He shook
hands with everybody&mdash;thanked everybody&mdash;invited
everybody when Mrs. A. should be better, and noted down in his
pocket-book what everybody prescribed as infallible remedies for
the measles, hooping-cough, small-pox, and rashes (both nettle and
tooth)&mdash;listened for hours to the praises of vaccination and
Indian-rubber rings&mdash;pronounced Goding&rsquo;s porter a real
blessing to mothers, and inquired the price of boys&rsquo; suits
and rocking-horses!</p>
<p>In this state of paternal felicity we must leave him till our
next.</p>

<h3>TO CAPITALISTS.</h3>
<p>It is rumoured that Macready is desirous of disposing of his
&ldquo;manners&rdquo; previous to becoming manager, when he will
have no further occasion for them. They are in excellent condition,
having been very little used, and would be a desirable purchase for
any one expecting to move within the sphere of his management.</p>

<p>The late Queen of the Sandwich Islands, and the first convert to

<h3>CAUTION TO SPORTSMEN.</h3>
<p>Our gallant friend Sibthorp backed himself on the 1st of
September to bag a hundred leverets in the course of the day. He
lost, of course; and upon being questioned as to his reason for
making so preposterous a bet, he confessed that he had been induced
to do so by the specious promise of an advertisement, in which
somebody professed to have discovered &ldquo;<em>a powder for the
removal of superfluous hairs</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<p>We concluded our last article with a brief dissertation on the
cut of the trousers; we will now proceed to the consideration of
coats.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The hour must come when such things must be
made.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For this quotation we are indebted to</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/009-02.png"><img src=
"images/009-02.png" alt="A man carries a book titled 'Poems'" id=
"img009-02" name="img009-02" width="30%" /></a>
<p>THE POET&rsquo;S PAGE.</p>
</div>
<p>There are three kinds of coats&mdash;the body, the surtout, and
the great.</p>
<p>The body-coat is again divided into classes, according to their
application, viz.&mdash;the drawing-room, the ride, and the
field.</p>
<p>The cut of the dress-coat is of paramount importance, that being
the garment which decorates the gentleman at a time when he is
naturally ambitious of going the entire D&rsquo;Orsay. There is
great nicety required in cutting this article of dress, so that it
may at one and the same moment display the figure and waistcoat of
the wearer to the utmost advantage. None but a John
o&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s goth would allow it to be imagined that the
buttons and button-holes of this <em>robe</em> were ever intended
to be anything but opposite neighbours, for a contrary conviction
would imply the absence of a cloak in the hall or a cab at the
door. We do not intend to give a Schneiderian dissertation upon
garments; we merely wish to trace outlines; but to those who are
anxious for a more intimate acquaintance with the intricacies and
mysteries of the delightful and civilising art of cutting, we can
only say, <em>Vide</em> Stultz.<sup>1</sup><span class=
"sidenote">1. Should any gentleman avail himself of this hint, we
should feel obliged if he would mention the source from whence it
was derived, having a small account standing in that quarter, for
tailors have gratitude.</span></p>
<p>The riding-coat is the connecting link between the DRESS and the
rest of the great family of coats, as <em>one</em> button, and one
only of this garment, may be allowed to be applied to his apparent
use.</p>
<p>It is so cut, that the waistcoat pockets may be easy of access.
Any gentleman who has attended races or other sporting meetings
must have found the convenience of this arrangement; for where the
course is well managed, as at Epsom, Ascot, Hampton, &amp;c., by
the judicious regulations of the stewards, the fingers are
generally employed in the distribution of those miniature argentine
medallions of her Majesty so particularly admired by ostlers,
correct card-vendors, E.O. table-keepers, Mr. Jerry, and the
toll-takers on the road and the course. The original idea of these
coats was accidentally given by John Day, who was describing, on
Nugee&rsquo;s cutting-board, the exact curvature of Tattenham
Corner.</p>
<p>The shooting-jacket should be designed after a dovecot or a
chest of drawers; and the great art in rendering this garment
perfect, is to make the coat entirely of pockets, that part which
covers the shoulders being only excepted, from the difficulty of
carrying even a cigar-case in that peculiar situation.</p>
<p>The surtout (not regulation) admits of very little design. It
can only be varied by the length of the skirts, which may be either
as long as a fireman&rsquo;s, or as short as Duvernay&rsquo;s
petticoats. This coat is, in fact, a cross between the dress and
the driving, and may, perhaps, be described as a Benjamin
junior.</p>
<p>Of the Benjamin senior, there are several kinds&mdash;the
Taglioni, the Pea, the Monkey, the Box, <em>et sui
generis</em>.</p>
<p>The three first are all of the coal-sackian cut, being, in fact,
elegant elongated pillow-cases, with two diminutive bolsters, which
are to be filled with arms instead of feathers. They are singularly
adapted for concealing the fall in the back, and displaying to the
greatest advantage those unassuming castors designated
&ldquo;Jerrys,&rdquo; which have so successfully rivalled those
silky impostors known to the world as</p>

"img009-03" width="50%" /></a>
<p>THIS (S)TILE&mdash;FOUR-AND-NINE.</p>
</div>
<p>The box-coat has, of late years, been denuded of its layers of
capes, and is now cut for the sole purpose, apparently, of
supporting perpendicular rows of wooden platters or mother-of-pearl
counters, each of which would be nearly large enough for the top of
a lady&rsquo;s work-table. Mackintosh-coats have, in some measure,
superseded the box-coat; but, like carters&rsquo; smock-frocks,
they are all the creations of speculative minds, having the great
advantage of keeping out the water, whilst they assist you in
becoming saturated with perspiration. We strongly suspect their
acquaintance with India-rubber; they seem to us to be a preparation
of English rheumatism, having rather more of the catarrh than
caoutchouc in their composition. Everybody knows the affinity of
India-rubber to black-lead; but when made into a Mackintosh, you
may substitute the <em>lum</em> for the <em>plum</em>bago.</p>
<p>We never see a fellow in a seal-skin cap, and one of these
waterproof pudding-bags, but we fancy he would make an excellent
model for</p>

<p>A friend insulted us the other day with the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Billy Black supposes Sam Rogers wears a
tightly-laced boddice. Why is it like one of Milton&rsquo;s
heroes?&rdquo; Seeing we gave it up, he
replied&mdash;&ldquo;Because

<h2>THE GOLDEN-SQUARE REVOLUTION.</h2>
<h3>[BY EXPRESS.]</h3>
<p>This morning, at an early hour, we were thrown into the greatest
consternation by a column of boys, who poured in upon us from the
northern entrance, and, taking up their-station near the pump, we
expected the worst.</p>
<p><em>8 o&rsquo;clock.</em>&mdash;The worst has not yet happened.
An inhabitant has entered the square-garden, and planted himself at
the back of the statue; but everything is in STATUE QUO.</p>
<p><em>5 minutes past 8.</em>&mdash;The boys are still there. The
square-keeper is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p><em>10 minutes past 8.</em>&mdash;The insurgents have, some of
them, mounted on the fire-escape. The square-keeper has been seen.
He is sneaking round the corner, and resolutely refuses to come
nearer.</p>
<p><em>&frac14; past 8.</em>&mdash;A deputation has waited on the
square-keeper. It is expected that he will resign.</p>
<p><em>20 minutes past 8.</em>&mdash;The square-keeper refuses to
resign.</p>
<p><em>22 minutes past 8.</em>&mdash;The square-keeper has
resigned.</p>
<p><em>25 minutes past 8.</em>&mdash;The boys have gone home.</p>
<p><em>&frac12; past 8.</em>&mdash;The square-keeper has been
restored, and is showing great courage and activity. It is not
thought necessary to place him under arms; but he is under the
engine, which can he brought into play at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
His activity is surprising, and his resolution quite undaunted.</p>
<p><em>9 o&rsquo;clock.</em>&mdash;All is perfectly quiet, and the
letters are being delivered by the general post-man as usual. The
inhabitants appear to be going to their business, as if nothing had
happened. The square-keeper, with the whole of his staff (a
constable&rsquo;s staff), may be seen walking quietly up and down.
The revolution is at an end; and, thanks to the fire-engine, our
old constitution is still preserved to us.</p>

<h2>RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRIP IN MR HAMPTON&rsquo;S BALLOON.</h2>
<h3>IN A LETTER FROM A WOULD-BE PASSENGER.</h3>
<p>My dear Friend.&mdash;You are aware how long I have been longing
to go up in a balloon, and that I should certainly have some time
ago ascended with Mr. Green, had not his terms been not simply a
<em>cut</em> above me, but several gashes beyond my power to comply
with them. In a word, I did not go up with the Nassau, because I
could not come down with the dust, and though I always had
&ldquo;Green in my eye,&rdquo; I was not quite so soft as to pay
twenty pounds in hard cash for the fun of going, on</p>

<p>A DARK (K)NIGHT,</p>
</div>
<p>nobody knows where, and coming down Heaven knows how, in a field
belonging to the Lord knows who, and being detained for goodness
knows what, for damage.</p>
<p>Not being inclined, therefore, for a nice and expensive voyage
with Mr. Green, I made a cheap and nasty arrangement with Mr.
Hampton, the gentleman who courageously offers to descend in a
parachute&mdash;a thing very like a parasol&mdash;and who, as he
never mounts much above the height of ordinary palings, might keep
his word without the smallest risk of any personal
inconvenience.</p>
<p>It was arranged and publicly announced that the balloon,
carrying its owner and myself, should start from the Tea-gardens of
the <em>Mitre and Mustard Pot</em>, at six o&rsquo;clock in the
evening; and the public were to be admitted at one, to see the
process of inflation, it being shrewdly calculated by the
proprietor, that, as the balloon got full, the stomachs of the
lookers on would be getting empty, and that the refreshments would
go off while the tedious work of filling a silken bag with gas was
going on, so that the appetites and the curiosity of the public
would be at the same time satisfied.</p>
<p>The process of inflation seemed to have but little effect on the
balloon, and it was not until about five o&rsquo;clock that the
important discovery was made, that the gas introduced at the bottom
had been escaping through a hole in the top, and that the Equitable
Company was laying it on excessively thick through the windpipes of
the assembled company.</p>
<p>Six o&rsquo;clock arrived, and, according to contract, the
supply of gas was cut off, when the balloon, that had hitherto worn
such an appearance as just to give a hope that it might in time be
full, began to present an aspect which induced a general fear that
it must very shortly be empty. The audience began to be impatient
for the promised ascent, and while the aeronaut was running about
in all directions looking for the hole, and wondering how he should
stop it up, I was requested by the proprietor of the gardens to
step into the car, just to check the growing impatience of the
audience. I was received with that unanimous shout of cheering and
laughter with which a British audience always welcomes any one who
appears to have got into an awkward predicament, and I sat for a
few minutes, quietly expecting to be buried in the silk of the
balloon, which was beginning to collapse with the greatest
rapidity. The spectators becoming impatient for the promised
ascent, and seeing that it could not be achieved, determined, as
enlightened British audiences invariably do, that if it was not to
be done, it should at all events be attempted. In vain did Mr.
Hampton come forward to apologise for the trifling accident; he was
met by yells, hoots, hisses, and orange-peel, and the benches were
just about to be torn up, when he declared, that under any
circumstances, he was determined to go up&mdash;an arrangement in
which I was refusing to coincide&mdash;when, just as he had got
into the car, all means of getting out were withdrawn from under
us&mdash;the ropes were cut, and the ascent commenced in
earnest.</p>
<p>The majestic machine rose slowly to the height of about eight
feet, amid the most enthusiastic cheers, when it rolled over among
some trees, amid the most frantic laughter. Mr. Hampton, with
singular presence of mind, threw out every ounce of ballast, which
caused the balloon to ascend a few feet higher, when a tremendous
gust of easterly wind took us triumphantly out of the gardens, the
palings of which we cleared with considerable nicety. The scene at
this moment was magnificent; the silken monster, in a state of
flabbiness, rolling and fluttering above, while below us were
thousands of spectators, absolutely shrieking with merriment.
Another gust of wind carried us rapidly forward, and, bringing us
exactly in a level with a coach-stand, we literally swept, with the
bottom of our car, every driver from off his box, and, of course,
the enthusiasm of a British audience almost reached its climax. We
now encountered the gable-end of a station-house, and the balloon
being by this time thoroughly collapsed, our aerial trip was
brought to an abrupt conclusion. I know nothing more of what
occurred, having been carried on a shutter, in a state of</p>

<p>to my own lodging, while my companion was left to fight it out
with the mob, who were so anxious to possess themselves of some
<em>memento</em> of the occasion, that the balloon was torn to
ribbons, and a fragment of it carried away by almost every one of
the vast multitude which had assembled to honour him with their
patronage.</p>

<h2>SYNCRETIC LITERATURE.</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The Loves of Giles Scroggins and Molly
Brown:&rdquo; an Epic Poem. London: CATNACH.</p>
<p>The great essentials necessary for the true conformation of the
sublimest effort of poetic genius, the construction of an
&ldquo;Epic Poem,&rdquo; are numerically three; viz., a beginning,
a middle, and an end. The incipient characters necessary to the
beginning, ripening in the middle, and, like the drinkers of small
beer and October leaves, falling in the end.</p>
<p>The poem being thus divided into its several stages, the
judgment of the writer should emulate that of the experienced Jehu,
who so proportions his work, that all and several of his required
teams do their own share and no more&mdash;fifteen miles (or
lengths) to a first canto, and five to a second, is as far from
right as such a distribution of mile-stones would be to the
overworked prads. The great fault of modern poetasters arises from
their extreme love of spinning out an infinite deal of nothing.
Now, as &ldquo;brevity is the soul of wit,&rdquo; their productions
can be looked upon as little else than phantasmagorial skeletons,
ridiculous from their extreme extenuation, and in appearance more
peculiarly empty, from the circumstance of their owing their
existence to false lights. This fault does not exist with all the
master spirits, and, though &ldquo;many a flower is born to blush
unseen,&rdquo; we now proceed to rescue from obscurity the
brightest gem of unfamed literature.</p>
<p>Wisdom is said to be found in the mouths of babes and sucklings.
So is the epic poem of Giles Scroggins. Is wisdom Scroggins, or is
Scroggins wisdom? We can prove either position, but we are cramped
for space, and therefore leave the question open. Now for our
author and his first line&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Giles Scroggins courted Molly Brown.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Beautiful condensation! Is or is not <em>this</em> rushing at
once in <em>medias res</em>? It is; there&rsquo;s no paltry
subterfuge about it&mdash;no unnecessary wearing out of &ldquo;the
waning moon they met by&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the stars that gazed
upon their joy&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the whispering gales that
breathed in zephyr&rsquo;s softest sighs&rdquo;&mdash;their
&ldquo;lover&rsquo;s perjuries to the distracted trees they
wouldn&rsquo;t allow to go to sleep.&rdquo; In short,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no nonsense&rdquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s a broad
assertion of a thrilling fact&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Giles Scroggins courted Molly Brown.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So might a thousand folks; therefore (the reader may say) how
does this establish the individuality of Giles Scroggins, or give
an insight to the character of the chosen hero of the poem? Mark
the next line, and your doubts must vanish. He courted her; but
why? Ay, why? for the best of all possible reasons&mdash;condensed
in the smallest of all possible space, and yet establishing his
perfect taste, unequalled judgment, and peculiarly-heroic
self-esteem&mdash;he courted her because she was</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The fairest maid in all the town.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Magnificent climax! overwhelming reason! Could volumes written,
printed, or stereotyped, say more? Certainly not; the condensation
of &ldquo;Aurora&rsquo;s blushes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Graces&rsquo;
attributes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus&rsquo;s perfections,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s sweet votaries,&rdquo; all, all is more than
spoken in the emphatic words&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The fairest maid in all the town.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nothing can go beyond this; it proves her beauty and her
disinterestedness. The <em>fairest</em> maid might have chosen,
nay, commanded, even a city dignitary. Does the so? No; Giles
Scroggins, famous only in name, loves her, and&mdash;beautiful
poetic contrivance!&mdash;we are left to imagine he does &ldquo;not
love unloved.&rdquo; Why should she reciprocate? inquires the
reader. Are not truth and generosity the princely paragons of manly
virtue, greater, because unostentatious? and these perfect
attributes are part and parcel of great Giles. He makes no
speeches&mdash;soils no satin paper&mdash;vows no vows&mdash;no, he
is above such humbug. His motto is evidently deeds, not words. And
what does he do? Send a flimsy epistle, which his fair reader pays
the vile postage for? Not he; he</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gave</em> a ring with <em>posy</em> true!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Think of this. Not only does he &ldquo;give a ring,&rdquo; but
he annihilates the suppositionary fiction in which poets are
supposed to revel, and the ring&rsquo;s accompaniment, though the
child of a creative brain&mdash;the burning emanation from some
Apollo-stricken votary of &ldquo;the lying nine,&rdquo; imbued with
all his stern morality, is strictly &ldquo;true.&rdquo; This
startling fact is not left wrapped in mystery. The veriest sceptic
cannot, in imagination, grave a fancied double meaning on that
richest gift. No&mdash;the motto follows, and seems to
say&mdash;Now, as the champion of Giles Scroggins, hurl I this
gauntlet down; let him that dare, uplift it! Here I am&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;If you <em>loves</em> I, as I <em>loves</em>
you!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pray mark the syncretic force of the above line. Giles, in
expressing his affection, felt the singular too small, and the vast
plural quick supplied the void&mdash;<em>Loves</em> must be more
than love.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;If you loves I, as I loves you,</p>
<p>No knife shall cut our loves in two!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is really sublime! &ldquo;No knife!&rdquo; Can anything
exceed the assertion? Nothing but the rejoinder&mdash;a rejoinder
in which the talented author not only stands proudly forward as a
poet, but patriotically proves the <em>amor propri&aelig;</em>,
which has induced him to study the staple manufactures of his
beloved country! What but a diligent investigation of the
<em>cut</em>lerian process could have prompted the illustration of
practical knowledge of the Birmingham and Sheffield artificers
contained in the following exquisitely explanatory line.
But&mdash;pray mark the <em>but</em>&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;But <em>scissors</em> cut as well as knives!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sublime announcement! startling information! leading us, by
degrees, to the highest of all earthly contemplations, exalting us
to fate and her peculiar shears, and preparing us for the
exquisitely poetical sequel contained in the following
line:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;And so un<em>sart</em>ain&rsquo;s all our
lives.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Can anything exceed this? The uncertainty of life evidently
superinduced the conviction of all other uncertainties, and the
sublime poet bears out the intenseness of his impressions by the
uncertainty of his spelling! Now, reader, mark the next line, and
its context:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The very night they were to wed!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fancy this: the full blossoming of all their budding joys,
anticipations, death, and hope&rsquo;s accomplishment, the crowning
hour of their youth&rsquo;s great bliss, &ldquo;<em>the very night
they were to wed</em>,&rdquo; is, with <em>extra syncretic</em>
skill, chosen as the awful one in which</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Fate&rsquo;s scissors cut Giles Scroggins&rsquo;
thread!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, reader, do you see the subtle use of practical knowledge?
Are you convinced of the impotent prescription from <em>knives</em>
only? Can you not perceive in &ldquo;<em>Fate&rsquo;s
scissors</em>&rdquo; a parallel for the unthought-of host
&ldquo;that bore the mighty wood of Dunsinane against the
blood-stained murderer of the pious Duncan?&rdquo; Does not the
fatal truth rush, like an unseen draught into rheumatic crannies,
slick through your soul&rsquo;s perception? Are you not prepared
for this&mdash;<em>to be resumed in our next</em>?</p>

<h3>THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.</h3>
<h4>FROM OUR OWN COURT CIRCULAR.</h4>
<p>Lord Lyndhurst is to have the seals; but it is not yet decided
who is to be entrusted with the wafer-stamps. Gold-stick has not
been appointed, and there are so many of the Conservatives whose
qualities peculiarly fit them for the office of <em>stick</em>,
that the choice will be exceedingly embarrassing.</p>
<p>Though the Duke of Wellington does not take office, an extra
chair has been ordered, to allow of his having a seat in the
Cabinet. And though Lord Melbourne is no longer minister, he is
still to be indulged with a lounge on the sofa.</p>
<p>If the Duke of Beaufort is to be Master of the Horse, it is
probable that a new office will be made, to allow Colonel Sibthorp
to take office as Comptroller of the Donkeys: and it is said that
Horace Twiss is to join the administration as Clerk of the
Kitchen.</p>
<p>It was remarked, that after Sir Robert Peel had kissed hands,
the Queen called for soap and water, for the purpose of washing
them.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Buccleugh having refused the office of Mistress
of the Robes, it will not be necessary to make the contemplated new
appointment of Keeper of the Flannel Petticoats.</p>
<p>The Grooms of the Bedchamber are, for the future, to be styled
Postilions of the Dressing-room; because, as the Sovereign is a
lady, instead of a gentleman, it is thought that the latter title,
for the officers alluded to, will be more in accordance with
propriety. For the same excellent reason, it is expected that the
Knights of the Bath will henceforth be designated the Chevaliers of
the Foot-pan.</p>
<p>Prince Albert&rsquo;s household is to be entirely re-modelled,
and one or two new offices are to be added, the want of which has
hitherto occasioned his Royal Highness much inconvenience. Of
these, we are only authorised in alluding, at present, to
Tooth-brush in Ordinary, and Shaving-pot in Waiting. There is no
foundation for the report that there is to be a Lord High
Clothes-brush, or Privy Boot-jack.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A VOICE FROM THE AREA.</h3>
<p>The following letter has been addressed to us by a certain
party, who, as our readers will perceive, has been one of the
sufferers by the late <em>clearance</em> made in a fashionable
establishment at the West-end:&mdash;</p>
<p>DEAR PUNCH.&mdash;As you may not be awair of the mallancoly
change wich as okkurred to the pore sarvunts here, I hassen to let
you no&mdash;that every sole on us as lost our plaices, and are
turnd owt&mdash;wich is a dredful klamity, seeing as we was all
very comfittible and appy as we was. I must say, in gustis to our
Missus, that she was very fond of us, and wouldn&rsquo;t have
parted with one of us if she had her will: but she&rsquo;s only a O
in her own howse, and is never aloud to do as she licks. We got
warning reglar enuff, but we still thort that somethink might turn
up in our fever. However, when the day cum that we was to go, it
fell upon us like a thunderboat. You can&rsquo;t imagine the
kunfewshion we was all threw into&mdash;every body packing up their
little afares, and rummidging about for any trifele that
wasn&rsquo;t worth leaving behind. The sarvunts as is cum in upon
us is a nice sett; they have been a long wile trying after our
places, and at last they have suckseeded in underminding us; but
it&rsquo;s my oppinion they&rsquo;ll never be able to get through
the work of the house;&mdash;all they cares for is the vails and
purkussites. I forgot to menshun that they hadn&rsquo;t the decency
to wait till we was off the peremasses, wich I bleave is the
<em>etticat</em> in sich cases, but rushed in on last Friday, and
tuck possession of all our plaices before we had left the concirn.
I leave you to judge by this what a hurry they was to get in.
There&rsquo;s one comfurt, however, that is&mdash;we&rsquo;ve left
things in sich a mess in the howse, that I don&rsquo;t think
they&rsquo;ll ever be able to set them to rites again. This is all
at present from your afflickted friend,</p>
<p class="rgt">JOHN THE FOOTMAN.</p>
<hr />
<p>&ldquo;I declare I never knew a <em>flatter</em> companion than
yourself,&rdquo; said Tom of Finsbury, the other evening, to the
lion of Lambeth. &ldquo;Thank you, Tom,&rdquo; replied the latter;
&ldquo;but all the world knows that you&rsquo;re a
<em>flatter-er</em>.&rdquo; Tom, in nautical phrase, swore, if he
ever came athwart his <em>Hawes</em>, that he would return the
compliment with interest.</p>

<h2>MY FRIEND TOM.</h2>
<div class="note">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Here, methinks,</p>
<p>Truth wants no ornament.&rdquo;&mdash;ROGERS.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have the happiness to know a gentleman of the name of Tom,
who officiates in the capacity of ostler. We have enjoyed a long
acquaintance with him&mdash;we mean an acquaintance a long way
off&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> from the window of our dormitory, which
overlooks A&mdash;s&mdash;n&rsquo;s stables. We believe we are the
first of our family, for some years, who has not kept a horse; and
we derive a melancholy gratification in gazing for hours, from our
lonely height, at the zoological possessions of more favoured
mortals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse is a noble animal,&rdquo; as a gentleman once
wittily observed, when he found himself, for the first time in his
life, in a position to make love; and we beg leave to repeat the
remark&mdash;&ldquo;the horse is a noble animal,&rdquo; whether we
consider him in his usefulness or in his beauty; whether
caparisoned in the <em>chamfrein</em> and <em>demi-peake</em> of
the chivalry of olden times, or scarcely fettered and surmounted by
the snaffle and hog-skin of the present; whether he excites our
envy when bounding over the sandy deserts of Arabia, or awakens our
sympathies when drawing sand from Hampstead and the parts adjacent;
whether we see him as romance pictures him, foaming in the lists,
or bearing, &ldquo;through flood and field,&rdquo; the brave, the
beautiful, and the benighted; or, as we know him in reality, the
companion of our pleasures, the slave of our necessities, the
dislocator of our necks, or one of the performers at our funeral;
whether&mdash;but we are not drawing a &ldquo;bill in
Chancery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such impressions in favour of the horse, we have ever felt
a deep anxiety about those to whom his conduct and comfort are
confided.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">The breeder&mdash;we envy.</p>
<p class="i2">The breaker&mdash;we pity.</p>
<p class="i2">The owner&mdash;we esteem.</p>
<p class="i2">The groom&mdash;we respect.</p>
<p class="i6">AND</p>
<p class="i2">The ostler&mdash;we pay.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Do not suppose that we wish to cast a slur upon the latter
personage, but it is too much to require that he who keeps a
caravansera should look upon every wayfarer as a brother. It is
thus with the ostler: <em>his</em> feelings are never allowed to
twine</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Around one object, till he feels his heart</p>
<p>Of its sweet being form a deathless part.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>No&mdash;to rub them down, give them a quartern and three
pen&rsquo;orth, and not too much water, are all that he has to
connect him with the offspring of Childers, Eclipse, or
Pot-8-o&rsquo;s; ergo, we pay him.</p>
<p>My friend Tom is a fine specimen of the genus. He is about
fifteen hands high, rising thirty, herring-bowelled, small head,
large ears, close mane, broad chest, and legs &agrave; la
parentheses ( ). His dress is a long brown-holland jacket, covering
the protuberance known in Bavaria by the name of <em>pudo</em>, and
in England by that of <em>bustle</em>. His breeches are of cord
about an inch in width, and of such capacious dimensions, that a
truss of hay, or a quarter of oats, might be stowed away in them
with perfect convenience: not that we mean to insinuate they are
ever thus employed, for when we have seen them, they have been in a
collapsed state, hanging (like the skin of an elephant) in graceful
festoons about the mid-person of the wearer. These necessaries are
confined at the knee by a transverse row of pearl buttons crossing
the <em>genu patella</em>. The <em>pars pendula</em> is about
twelve inches wide, and supplies, during conversation or
rumination, a resting-place for the thumbs or little fingers. His
legs are encased either in white ribbed cotton stockings, or that
peculiar kind of gaiter &rsquo;yclept <em>kicksies</em>. His feet
know only one pattern shoe, the <em>ancle-jack</em> (or
<em>highlow</em> as it is sometimes called), resplendent with
&ldquo;Day and Martin,&rdquo; or the no less brilliant
&ldquo;Warren.&rdquo; Genius of propriety, we have described his
tail before that index of the mind, that idol of phrenologists, his
pimple!&mdash;we beg pardon, we mean his head. Round, and rosy as a
pippin, it stands alone in its native loveliness, on the heap of
clothes beneath.</p>
<p>Tom is not a low man; he has not a particle of costermongerism
in his composition, though his discourse savours of that peculiar
slang that might be considered rather objectionable in the
<em>salons</em> of the <em>&eacute;lite</em>.</p>
<p>The bell which he has the honour to answer hangs at the gate of
a west-end livery-stables, and his consequence is proportionate. To
none under the degree of a groom does he condescend a nod of
recognition&mdash;with a second coachman he drinks porter&mdash;and
purl (a compound of beer and blue ruin) with the more respectable
individual who occupies the hammer-cloth on court-days. Tom
estimates a man according to his horse, and his civility is
regulated according to his estimation. He pockets a gratuity with
as much ease as a state pensioner; but if some unhappy wight
should, in the plenitude of his ignorance, proffer a sixpence, Tom
buttons his pockets with a smile, and politely &ldquo;begs to leave
it till it becomes more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an old meerschaum and a pint of tolerable sherry, we seat
ourselves at our window, and hold many an imaginative conversation
with our friend Tom. Sometimes we are blest with more than
ideality; but that is only when he unbends and becomes jocular and
noisy, or chooses a snug corner opposite our window to enjoy his
<em>otium</em>&mdash;confound that phrase!&mdash;we would say his
indolence and swagger&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;A pound to a hay-seed agin&rsquo; the bay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hallo! that&rsquo;s Tom! Yes&mdash;there he comes laughing out
of &ldquo;Box 4,&rdquo; with three others&mdash;all <em>first</em>
coachmen. One is making some very significant motions to the potboy
at the &ldquo;Ram and Radish,&rdquo; and, lo! Ganymede appears with
a foaming tankard of ale. Tom has taken his seat on an inverted
pail, and the others are grouped easily, if not classically, around
him.</p>
<p>One is resting his head between the prongs of a stable-fork;
another is spread out like the Colossus of Rhodes; whilst a
gentleman in a blue uniform has thrown himself into an attitude
&agrave; la Cribb, with the facetious intention of &ldquo;letting
daylight into the <em>wittling</em> department&rdquo; of the
pot-boy of the &ldquo;Ram and Radish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom has blown the froth from the tankard, and (as he elegantly
designates it) &ldquo;bit his name in the pot.&rdquo; A second has
&ldquo;looked at the maker&rsquo;s name;&rdquo; and another has
taken one of those positive draughts which evince a settled
conviction that it is a last chance.</p>
<p>Our friend has thrust his hands into the deepest depths of his
breeches-pocket, and cocking one eye at the afore-named blue
uniform, asks&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Will</em> you back the bay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inquiry has been made in such a do-if-you-dare tone, that to
hesitate would evince a cowardice unworthy of the first coachman to
the first peer in Belgrave-square, and a leg of mutton and
trimmings are duly entered in a greasy pocket-book, as dependent
upon the result of the Derby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of Tros, fair Ganymede,&rdquo; is again called
into requisition, and the party are getting, as Tom says, &ldquo;As
happy as Harry Stockracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often heerd that chap mentioned,&rdquo;
remarks the blue uniform, &ldquo;but I never seed no one as
know&rsquo;d him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more did I,&rdquo; replies Tom, &ldquo;though he must
be a fellow such as us, up to everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the coachmen cough, strike an attitude, and look wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here comes a sort of chap I despises,&rdquo; remarks
Tom, pointing to a steady-looking man, without encumbrance, who had
just entered the yard, evidently a coachman to a pious family;
&ldquo;see him handle a <em>hoss</em>. Smear&mdash;smear&mdash;like
bees-waxing a table. Nothing varminty about him&mdash;nothing of
this sort of thing (spreading himself out to the gaze of his
admiring auditory), but I suppose he&rsquo;s useful with slow
cattle, and that&rsquo;s a consolation to us as can&rsquo;t abear
them.&rdquo; And with this negative compliment Tom has broken up
his <em>conversazione</em>.</p>
<p>I once knew a country ostler&mdash;by name Peter Staggs&mdash;he
was a lower species of the same genus&mdash;a sort of compound of
my friend Tom and a waggoner&mdash;the <em>delf</em> of the
profession. He was a character in his way; he knew the exact moment
of every coach&rsquo;s transit on his line of road, and the birth,
parentage, and education of every cab, hack, and draught-horse in
the neighbourhood. He had heard of a mane-comb, but had never seen
one; he considered a shilling for a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; perfectly
apocryphal, as he had never received one. He kept a rough
terrier-dog, that would kill anything in the country, and exhibited
three rows of putrified rats, nailed at the back of the stable, as
evidences of the prowess of his dog. He swore long country oaths,
for which he will be unaccountable, as not even an angel could
transcribe them. In short, he was a little &ldquo;varminty,&rdquo;
but very little.</p>
<p>We will conclude this &ldquo;lytle historie&rdquo; with the
epitaph of poor Peter Staggs, which we copied from a rail in
Swaffham churchyard.</p>
<p class="cen">&ldquo;EPITAPH ON PETER STAGGS.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Poor Peter Staggs now rests beneath this rail,</p>
<p>Who loved his joke, his pipe, and mug of ale;</p>
<p>For twenty years he did the duties well,</p>
<p>Of ostler, boots, and waiter at the &lsquo;Bell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Death stepp&rsquo;d in, and order&rsquo;d Peter Staggs</p>
<p>To feed his worms, and leave the farmers&rsquo; nags.</p>
<p>The church clock struck one&mdash;alas! &rsquo;twas
Peter&rsquo;s knell,</p>
<p>Who sigh&rsquo;d, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;that&rsquo;s the

<h2>PEEL &ldquo;REGULARLY CALLED IN.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>At length, PEEL is called in &ldquo;in a regular way.&rdquo;
Being assured of his quarterly fee, the state physician may now, in
the magnanimity of his soul, prescribe new life for moribund John
Bull. Whether he has resolved within himself to emulate the
generous dealing of kindred professors&mdash;of those sanative
philosophers, whose benevolence, stamped in modest handbills,
&ldquo;crieth out in the street,&rdquo; exclaiming &ldquo;No cure
no pay,&rdquo;&mdash;we know not; certain we are, that such is not
the old Tory practice. On the contrary, the healing, with Tory
doctors, has ever been in an inverse ratio to the reward. Like the
faculty at large, the Tories have flourished on the sickness of the
patient. They have, with <em>Falstaff</em>, &ldquo;turned diseases
to commodity;&rdquo; their only concern being to keep out the
undertaker. Whilst there&rsquo;s life, there&rsquo;s
profit,&mdash;is the philosophy of the Tory College; hence, poor
Mr. Bull, though shrunk, attenuated,&mdash;with a blister on his
head, and cataplasms at his soles,&mdash;has been kept just alive
enough to pay. And then his patience under Tory treatment&mdash;the
obedience of his swallow! &ldquo;Admirable, excellent!&rdquo; cried
a certain doctor (we will not swear that his name was not PEEL),
when his patient pointed to a dozen empty phials. &ldquo;Taken them
all, eh? Delightful! My dear sir, you are <em>worthy</em> to be
ill.&rdquo; JOHN BULL having again called in the Tories, is
&ldquo;worthy to be ill;&rdquo; and very ill he will be.</p>
<p>The tenacity of life displayed by BULL is paralleled by a case
quoted by LE VAILLANT. That naturalist speaks of a turtle that
continued to live after its brain was taken from its skull, and the
cavity stuffed <em>with cotton</em>. Is not England, with
spinning-jenny PEEL at the head of its affairs, in this precise
predicament? England may live; but inactive, torpid; unfitted for
all healthful exertion,&mdash;deprived of its grandest
functions&mdash;paralyzed in its noblest strength. We have a Tory
Cabinet, but where is the <em>brain</em> of statesmanship?</p>
<p>Now, however, there are no Tories. Oh, no! Sir ROBERT PEEL is a
Conservative&mdash;LYNDHURST is a Conservative&mdash;all are
Conservative. Toryism has sloughed its old skin, and rejoices in a
new coat of many colours; but the sting remains&mdash;the venom is
the same; the reptile that would have struck to the heart the
freedom of Europe, elaborates the self-same poison, is endowed with
the same subtilty, the same grovelling, tortuous action. It still
creeps upon its belly, and wriggles to its purpose. When adders
shall become eels, then will we believe that Conservatives cannot
be Tories.</p>
<p>When folks change their names&mdash;unless by the gracious
permission of the <em>Gazette</em>&mdash;they rarely do so to avoid
the fame of brilliant deeds. It is not the act of an over-sensitive
modesty that induces <em>Peter Wiggins</em> to dub himself <em>John
Smith</em>. Be certain of it, <em>Peter</em> has not saved half a
boarding-school from the tremendous fire that entirely destroyed
&ldquo;Ringworm House&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Peter</em> has not dived
into the Thames, and rescued some respectable attorney from a death
hitherto deemed by his friends impossible to him. It is from no
such heroism that <em>Peter Wiggins</em> is compelled to take
refuge in <em>John Smith</em> from the oppressive admiration of the
world about him. Certainly not. Depend upon it, <em>Peter</em> has
been signalised in the <em>Hue and Cry</em>, as one endowed with a
love for the silver spoons of other men&mdash;as an individual who,
abusing the hospitality of his lodgings, has conveyed away and sold
the best goose feathers of his landlady. What then, with his name
ripe enough to drop from the tree of life, remains to
<em>Wiggins</em>, but to subside into <em>Smith</em>? What hope was
there for the well-known swindler, the posted pickpocket, the
callous-hearted, slug-brained <em>Tory</em>? None: he was hooted,
pelted at; all men stopped the nose at his approach. He was voted a
nuisance, and turned forth into the world, with all his vices, like
ulcers, upon him. Well, <em>Tory</em> adopts the inevitable policy
of <em>Wiggins</em>; he changes his name! He comes forth, curled
and sweetened, and with a smile upon his mealy face, and placing
his felon hand above the <em>vacuum</em> on the left side of his
bosom&mdash;declares, whilst the tears he weeps would make a
crocodile blush&mdash;that he is by no means the <em>Tory</em> his
wicked, heartless enemies would call him. Certainly not. His name
is&mdash;<em>Conservative!</em> There was, once, to be sure, a
<em>Tory</em>&mdash;in existence;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;But he is dead, and nailed in his chest!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He is a creature extinct, gone with the wolves annihilated by
the Saxon monarch. There may be the skeleton of the animal in some
rare collections in the kingdom; but for the living creature, you
shall as soon find a phoenix building in the trees of Windsor Park,
as a <em>Tory</em> kissing hands in Windsor Castle!</p>
<p>The lie is but gulped as a truth, and <em>Conservative</em> is
taken into service. Once more, he is the <em>factotum</em> to JOHN
BULL. But when the knave shall have worn out his second
name&mdash;when he shall again be turned away&mdash;look to your
feather-beds, oh, JOHN! and foolish, credulous, leathern-eared Mr.
BULL&mdash;be sure and count your spoons!</p>
<p>Can it be supposed that the loss of office, that the ten
years&rsquo; hunger for the loaves and fishes endured by the Tory
party, has disciplined them into a wiser humanity? Can it be
believed that they have arrived at a more comprehensive grasp of
intellect&mdash;that they are ennobled by a loftier consideration
of the social rights of man&mdash;that they are gifted with a more
stirring sympathy for the wants that, in the present iniquitous
system of society, reduce him to little less than pining idiotcy,
or madden him to what the statutes call crime, and what judges,
sleek as their ermine, preach upon as rebellion to the
government&mdash;the government that, in fact, having stung
starvation into treason, takes to itself the loftiest praise for
refusing the hangman&mdash;a task&mdash;for appeasing
<em>Justice</em> with simple transportation?</p>
<p>Already the Tories have declared themselves. In the flush of
anticipated success, PEEL at the Tamworth election denounced the
French Revolution that escorted Charles the Tenth&mdash;with his
foolish head still upon his shoulders&mdash;out of France, as the
&ldquo;triumph of might over right.&rdquo; It was the
right&mdash;the divine right of Charles&mdash;(the sacred
<em>ampoule</em>, yet dropping with the heavenly oil brought by the
mystic dove for Clovis, had bestowed the privilege)&mdash;to gag
the mouth of man; to scourge a nation with decrees, begot by bigot
tyranny upon folly&mdash;to reduce a people into uncomplaining
slavery. Such was his right: and the burst of indignation, the
irresistible assertion of the native dignity of man, that shivered
the throne of Charles like glass, was a felonious might&mdash;a
rebellious, treasonous potency&mdash;the very wickedness of
strength. Such is the opinion of Conservative PEEL! Such the old
Tory faith of the child of Toryism!</p>
<p>Since the Tamworth speech&mdash;since the scourging of Sir
ROBERT by the French press&mdash;PEEL has essayed a small
philanthropic oration. He has endeavoured to paint&mdash;and
certainly in the most delicate water-colours&mdash;the horrors of
war. The premier makes his speech to the nations with the
palm-branch in his hand&mdash;with the olive around his brow. He
has applied arithmetic to war, and finds it expensive. He would
therefore induce France to disarm, that by reductions at home he
may not be compelled to risk what would certainly jerk him out of
the premiership&mdash;the imposition of new taxes. He may then keep
his Corn Laws&mdash;he may then securely enjoy his sliding scale.
Such are the hopes that dictate the intimation to disarm. It is
sweet to prevent war; and, oh! far sweeter still to keep out the
Wigs!</p>
<p>The Duke of WELLINGTON, who is to be the moral force of the Tory
Cabinet, is a great soldier; and by the very greatness of his
martial fame, has been enabled to carry certain political questions
which, proposed by a lesser genius, had been scouted by the party
otherwise irresistibly compelled to admit them. (Imagine, for
instance, the Marquis of Londonderry handling Catholic
Emancipation.) Nevertheless, should &ldquo;The follies of the
Wise&rdquo;&mdash;a chronicle much wanted&mdash;be ever collected
for the world, his Grace of Wellington will certainly shine as a
conspicuous contributor. In the name of famine, what could have
induced his Grace to insult the misery at this moment, eating the
hearts of thousands of Englishmen? For, within these few days, the
Victor of Waterloo expressed his conviction that England was the
only country in which &ldquo;<em>the poor man, if only sober and
industrious</em>, WAS QUITE CERTAIN <em>of acquiring a
competency!</em>&rdquo; And it is this man, imbued with this
opinion, who is to be hailed as the presiding wisdom&mdash;the
great moral strength&mdash;the healing humanity of the Tory
Cabinet. If rags and starvation put up their prayer to the present
Ministry, what must be the answer delivered by the Duke of
Wellington? &ldquo;YE ARE DRUNKEN AND LAZY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If on the night of the 24th of August&mdash;the memorable night
on which this heartless insult was thrown in the idle teeth of
famishing thousands&mdash;the ghosts of the victims of the Corn
Laws,&mdash;the spectres of the wretches who had been ground out of
life by the infamy of Tory taxation, could have been permitted to
lift the bed-curtains of Apsley-House,&mdash;his Grace the Duke of
Wellington would have been scared by even a greater majority than
ultimately awaits his fellowship in the present Cabinet. Still we
can only visit upon the Duke the censure of ignorance. &ldquo;He
knows not what he says.&rdquo; If it be his belief that England
suffers only because she is drunken and idle, he knows no more of
England than the Icelander in his sledge: if, on the other hand, he
used the libel as a party warfare, he is still one of the
&ldquo;old set,&rdquo;&mdash;and his &ldquo;crowning carnage,
Waterloo,&rdquo; with all its greatness, is but a poor set-off
against the more lasting iniquities which he would visit upon his
fellow-men. Anyhow, he cannot&mdash;he must not&mdash;escape from
his opinion; we will nail him to it, as we would nail a weasel to a
barn-door; &ldquo;<em>if Englishmen want competence, they must be
drunken&mdash;they must be idle</em>.&rdquo; Gentlemen Tories,
shuffle the cards as you will, the Duke of Wellington either lacks
principle or brains.</p>
<p>Next week we will speak of the Whigs; of the good they have
done&mdash;of the good they have, with an instinct towards
aristocracy&mdash;most foolishly, most traitorously, missed.</p>

<h2>TRANSACTIONS AND YEARLY REPORT OF THE HOOKHAM-CUM-SNIVEY
LITERARY, SCIENTIFIC, AND MECHANICS&rsquo; INSTITUTION.</h2>
<p class="note">Collected and elaborated expressly for
&ldquo;PUNCH,&rdquo; by Tiddledy Winks, Esq., Hon. Sec., and Editor
of the <em>Peckham Evening Post</em> and <em>Camberwell-Green
Advertiser</em>.</p>
<p>Previously to placing the results of my unwearied application
before the public, I think it will be both interesting and
appropriate to trace, in a few words, the origin of this admirable
society, by whose indefatigable exertions the air-pump has become
necessary to the domestic economy of every peasant&rsquo;s cottage;
and the Budelight and beer-shops, optics and out-door relief, and
Daguerrotypes and dirt, have become subjects with which they are
equally familiar.</p>
<p>About the close of last year, a few scientific labourers were in
the habit of meeting at a &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; in their
neighbourhood, for the purpose of discussing such matters as the
comprehensive and plainly-written reports of the British
Association, as furnished by the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, offered
to their notice, in any way connected with philosophy or the
<em>belles lettres</em>. The numbers increasing, it was proposed
that they should meet weekly at one another&rsquo;s cottages, and
there deliver a lecture on any scientific subject; and the
preliminary matters being arranged, the first discourse was given
&ldquo;On the Advantage of an Air-gun over a Fowling-piece, in
bringing Pheasants down without making a noise.&rdquo; This was so
eminently successful, that the following discourses were delivered
in quick succession:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>On the Toxicological Powers of Coculus Indicus in Stupifying
Fish.</p>
<p>On the Combustion of Park-palings and loose Gate-posts.</p>
<p>On the tendency of Out-of-door Spray-piles to Spontaneous
Evaporation, during dark nights.</p>
<p>On the Comparative Inflammatory properties of Lucifer Matches,
Phosphorus Bottles, Tinder-boxes, and Congreves, as well as
Incandescens Short Pipes, applied to Hay in particular and Ricks in
general.</p>
<p>On the value of Cheap Literature, and Intrinsic Worth (by
weight) of the various Publications of the Society for the
Confusion of Useless Knowledge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The lectures were all admirably illustrated, and the society
appeared to be in a prosperous state. At length the government
selected two or three of its most active members, and despatched
them on a voyage of discovery to a distant part of the globe. The
institution now drooped for a while, until some friends of
education firmly impressed with the importance of their
undertaking, once more revived its former greatness, at the same
time entirely reorganizing its arrangements. Subscriptions were
collected, sufficient to erect a handsome turf edifice, with a
massy thatched roof, upon Timber Common; a committee was appointed
to manage the scientific department, at a liberal salary, including
the room to sit in, turf, and rushlights, with the addition, on
committee nights, of a pint of intermediate beer, a pipe, and a
screw, to each member. Gentlemen fond of hearing their own voices
were invited to give gratuitous discourses from sister
institutions: a museum and library were added to the building
already mentioned, and an annual meeting of <em>illuminati</em> was
agreed upon.</p>
<p>Amongst the papers contributed to be read at the evening
meetings of the society, perhaps the most interesting was that
communicated by Mr. Octavius Spiff, being a startling and probing
investigation as to whether Sir Isaac Newton had his hat on when
the apple tumbled on his head, what sort of an apple it most
probably was, and whether it actually fell from the tree upon him,
or, being found too hard and sour to eat, had been pitched over his
garden wall by the hand of an irritated little boy. I ought also to
make mention of Mr. Plummycram&rsquo;s &ldquo;Narrative of an
Ascent to the summit of Highgate-hill,&rdquo; with Mr.
Mulltour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook for Travellers from the Bank to
Lisson-grove,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Summer&rsquo;s-day on
Kennington-common.&rdquo; Mr. Tinhunt has also announced an
attractive work, to be called &ldquo;Hackney: its Manufactures,
Economy, and Political Resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the intention of the society, should its funds increase,
to take a high place next year in the scientific transactions of
the country. Led by the spirit of enterprise now so universally
prevalent, arrangements are pending with Mr. Purdy, to fit up two
punts for the Shepperton expedition, which will set out in the
course of the ensuing summer. The subject for the Prize Essay for
the Victoria Penny Coronation Medal this year is, &ldquo;The
possibility of totally obliterating the black stamp on the
post-office Queen&rsquo;s heads, so as to render them serviceable a
second time;&rdquo; and, in imitation of the learned investigations
of sister institutions, the Copper Jinks Medal will also be given
to the author of the best essay upon &ldquo;The existing analogy
between the mental subdivision of invisible agencies and
circulating decompositions.&rdquo;&mdash;(<em>To be
continued.</em>)</p>

<h2>INAUGURATION OF THE IMAGE OF SHAKSPERE.</h2>
<h3>AT THE SURREY THEATRE.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Be still, my mighty soul! These ribs of mine</p>
<p>Are all too fragile for thy narrow cage.</p>
<p>By heaven! I will unlock my bosom&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>And blow thee forth upon the boundless tide</p>
<p>Of thought&rsquo;s creation, where thy eagle wing</p>
<p>May soar from this dull terrene mass away,</p>
<p>To yonder empyrean vault&mdash;like rocket (sky)&mdash;</p>
<p>To mingle with thy cognate essences</p>
<p>Of Love and Immortality, until</p>
<p>Thou burstest with thine own intensity,</p>
<p>And scatterest into millions of bright stars,</p>
<p>Each <em>one</em> a part of that refulgent whole</p>
<p>Which once was ME.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus spoke, or thought&mdash;for, in a metaphysical point of
view, it does not much matter whether the passage above quoted was
uttered, or only conceived&mdash;by the sublime philosopher and
author of the tragedy of &ldquo;Martinuzzi,&rdquo; now being
nightly played at the English Opera House, with unbounded success,
to overflowing audiences<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2. Has
this paragraph been paid for as an
advertisement?&mdash;PRINTER&rsquo;S
DEVIL.&mdash;Undoubtedly.&mdash;ED.</span>. These were the
aspirations of his gigantic mind, as he sat, on last Monday
morning, like a simple mortal, in a striped-cotton dressing-gown
and drab slippers, over a cup of weak coffee. (We love to be minute
on great subjects.) The door opened, and a female figure&mdash;not
the Tragic muse&mdash;but Sally, the maid of-all-work, entered,
holding in a corner of her dingy apron, between her delicate finger
and thumb, a piece of not too snowy paper, folded into an exact
parallelogram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter for you, sir,&rdquo; said the maid of-all-work,
dropping a reverential curtsey.</p>
<p>George Stephens, Esq. took the despatch in his inspired fingers,
broke the seal, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Surrey Theatre</em>.</p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I have seen your tragedy of &ldquo;Martinuzzi,&rdquo;
and pronounce it magnificent! I have had, for some time, an idea in
my head (how it came there I don&rsquo;t know), to produce, after
the Boulogne affair, a grand Inauguration of the Statue of
Shakspere, on the stage of the Surrey, but not having an image of
him amongst our properties, I could not put my plan into execution.
Now, sir, as it appears that you are the exact ditto of the bard, I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind making an arrangement with you to undertake
the character of <em>our friend Billy</em> on the occasion. I shall
do the liberal in the way of terms, and get up the gag properly,
with laurels and other greens, of which I have a large stock on
hand; so that with your popularity the thing will be sure to draw.
If you consent to come, I&rsquo;ll post you in six-feet letters
against every dead wall in town.</p>
<p>Yours,<br />
WILLIS JONES.</p>
<p>When the author of the &ldquo;magnificent poem&rdquo; had
finished reading the letter he appeared deeply moved, and the maid
of-all-work saw three plump tears roll down his manly cheek, and
rest upon his shirt collar. &ldquo;I expected nothing less,&rdquo;
said he, stroking his chin with a mysterious air. &ldquo;The
manager of the Surrey, at least, understands me&mdash;<em>he</em>
appreciates the immensity of my genius. I <em>will</em> accept his
offer, and show the world&mdash;great Shakspere&rsquo;s rival in
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, the immortal dramatist wiped his hands on
the tail of his dressing-gown, and performed a <em>pas seul</em>
&ldquo;as the act directs,&rdquo; after which he dressed himself,
and emerged into the open air.</p>
<p>The sun was shining brilliantly, and Phoebus remarked, with
evident pleasure, that his brother had bestowed considerable pains
in adorning his person. His boots shone with unparalleled
splendour, and his waistcoat&mdash;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p class="note">[We omit the remainder of the inventory of the
great poet&rsquo;s wardrobe, and proceed at once to the ceremony of
the Inauguration at the Surrey Theatre.]</p>
<p>Never on any former occasion had public curiosity over the water
been so strongly excited. Long before the doors of the theatre were
opened, several passengers in the street were observed to pause
before the building, and regard it with looks of profound awe. At
half-past six, two young sweeps and a sand-boy were seen waiting
anxiously at the gallery entrance, determined to secure front seats
at any personal sacrifice. At seven precisely the doors were
opened, and a tremendous rush of four persons was made to the pit;
the boxes had been previously occupied by the &ldquo;Dramatic
Council&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Syncretic Society.&rdquo; The silence
which pervaded the house, until the musicians began to tune their
violins in the orchestra, was thrilling; and during the performance
of the overture, expectation stood on tip-toe, awaiting the great
event of the night.</p>
<p>At length the curtain slowly rose, and we discovered the author
of &ldquo;Martinuzzi&rdquo; elevated on a pedestal formed of the
cask used by the celebrated German tub-runner (a delicate
compliment, by the way, to the genius of the poet). On this
appropriate foundation stood the great man, with his august head
enveloped in a capacious bread-bag. At a given signal, a vast
quantity of crackers were let off, the envious bag was withdrawn,
and the illustrious dramatist was revealed to the enraptured
spectators, in the statuesque resemblance of his elder, but not
more celebrated brother, WILLIAM SHAKSPERE. At this moment the
plaudits were vigorously enthusiastic. Thrice did the flattered
statue bow its head, and once it laid its hand upon its grateful
bosom, in acknowledgment of the honour that was paid it. As soon as
the applause had partially subsided, the manager, in the character
of <em>Midas</em>, surrounded by the nine Muses, advanced to the
foot of the pedestal, and, to use the language of the reporters of
public dinners, &ldquo;in a neat and appropriate speech,&rdquo;
deposed a laurel crown upon the brows of Shakspere&rsquo;s effigy.
Thereupon loud cheers rent the air, and the statue, deeply
affected, extended its right hand gracefully towards the audience.
In a moment the thunders of applause sank into hushed and listening
awe, while the author of the &ldquo;magnificent poem&rdquo;
addressed the house as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&mdash;You at length behold me in the position
to which my immense talents have raised me, in despite of
&lsquo;those laws which press so fatally on dramatic genius,&rsquo;
and blight the budding hopes of aspiring authors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This commencement softened the hearts of his auditors, who
clapped their handkerchiefs to their noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; continued the statue, &ldquo;may regard
me with envy; but I despise the world, particularly the critics who
have dared to laugh at me. (Groans.) The object of my ambition is
attained&mdash;I am now the equal and representative of
Shakspere&mdash;detraction cannot wither the laurels that shadow my
brows&mdash;<em>Finis coronat opus!</em>&mdash;I have done.
To-morrow I retire into private life; but though fortune has made
me great, she has not made me proud, and I shall be always happy to
shake hands with a friend when I meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this pathetic address, loud cheers, mingled
with tears and sighs, arose from the audience, one-half of whom
sunk into the arms of the other half, and were borne out of the
house in a fainting state; and thus terminated this imposing
ceremony, which will be long remembered with delight by every lover
of</p>

<p>THE HIGHER WALK OF THE DRAMA.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>A CARD.</h3>
<h4>TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE DRAMATIC AUTHORS,</h4>
<h5>ENGLISH OPERA HOUSE.</h5>
<p>Mr. Levy, of Holywell-street, perceiving that his neighbour
JACOB FAITHFUL&rsquo;S farce, entitled &ldquo;The Cloak and
Bonnet,&rdquo; has not given general satisfaction, begs
respectfully to offer to the notice of the committee, his large and
carefully-assorted stock of second-hand wearing apparel, from which
he will undertake to supply any number of dramas that may be
required, at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Mr. L. has at present on hand the following dramatic pieces,
which he can strongly recommend to the public:&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The Dressing Gown and Slippers.&rdquo;&mdash;A
fashionable comedy, suited for a genteel neighbourhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The Breeches and Gaiters.&rdquo;&mdash;A domestic drama.
A misfit at the Adelphi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The Wig and Wig-box.&rdquo;&mdash;A broad farce, made to
fit little Keeley or anybody else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The Smock-frock and Highlows.&rdquo;&mdash;A tragedy in
humble life, with a terrific <em>d&eacute;nouement</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*&lowast;* The above will be found to be manufactured out of the
best materials, and well worthy the attention of those gentlemen
who have so nobly come forward to rescue the stage from its present
degraded position.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE MONEY MARKET.</h3>
<p>The scarcity of money is frightful. As much as a hundred per
cent., to be paid in advance, has been asked upon bills; but we
have not yet heard of any one having given it. There was an immense
run for gold, but no one got any, and the whole of the transactions
of the day were done in copper. An influential party created some
sensation by coming into the market late in the afternoon, just
before the close of business, with half-a-crown; but it was found,
on inquiry, to be a bad one. It is expected that if the dearth of
money continues another week, buttons must be resorted to. A party,
whose transactions are known to be large, succeeded in settling his
account with the Bulls, by means of postage-stamps; an arrangement
of which the Bears will probably take advantage.</p>
<p>A large capitalist in the course of the day attempted to change
the direction things had taken, by throwing an immense quantity of
paper into the market; but as no one seemed disposed to have
anything to do with it, it blew over.</p>
<p>The parties to the Dutch Loan are much irritated at being asked
to take their dividends in butter; but, after the insane attempt to
get rid of the Spanish arrears by cigars, which, it is well known,
ended in smoke, we do not think the Dutch project will be proceeded
with.</p>

<h2>THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.</h2>
<h3>BY THE REPORTER OF THE &ldquo;OBSERVER.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;mysterious and melodramatic silence&rdquo; which Mr.
C. Mathews promised to observe as to his intentions in regard to
the present season, has at length been broken. On Monday last,
September the sixth, Covent Garden Theatre opened to admit a most
brilliant audience. Amongst the <em>company</em> we noticed Madame
Vestris, Mr. Oxberry, Mr. Harley, Miss Rainsforth, and several
other <em>distingu&eacute; artistes</em>. It would seem, from the
substitution of Mr. Oxberry for Mr. Keeley, that the former
gentleman is engaged to take the place of the latter. Whispers are
afloat that, in consequence, one of the most important scenes in
the play is to be omitted. Though of little interest to the
audience, it was of the highest importance to the gentleman whose
task it has hitherto been to perform the parts of Quince, Bottom,
and Flute.</p>
<p>We, who are conversant with all the mysteries of the
<em>flats&rsquo;</em> side of the <em>green</em> curtain, beg to
assure our readers, that the Punch scene hath taken <em>wing</em>,
and that the dressing-room of the above-named characters will no
longer be redolent of the fumes of compounded bowls. We may here
remark that, had our hint of last season been attended to, the
Punch would have still been continued:&mdash;Mr. Harley would not
consent to have the flies picked out of the sugar. Rumour is busy
with the suggestion that for this reason, and this only, Keeley
seceded from the establishment.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/009-10.png"><img src=
"images/009-10.png" alt=
"Three characters pour into a bowl marked PUNCH." id="img009-10"
name="img009-10" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p>We think it exceedingly unwise in the management not to have
secured the services of Madame Corsiret for the millinery
department. Mr. Wilson still supplies the wigs. We have not as yet
been able to ascertain to whom the swords have been consigned. Mr.
Emden&rsquo;s assistant superintends the blue-fire and thunder, but
it has not transpired who works the traps.</p>
<p>With such powerful auxiliaries, we can promise Mr. C. Mathews a
prosperous season.</p>

<h3>PROVIDING FOR EVIL DAYS.</h3>
<p>The <em>iniquities</em> of the Tories having become proverbial,
the House of Lords, with that consideration for the welfare of the
country, and care for the morals of the people, which have ever
characterised the compeers of the Lord Coventry, have brought in a
bill for the creation of <em>two</em> <em>Vice</em>-Chancellors.

sufficient, but found himself in a <em>singular</em> minority when

<p>In the Egyptian room of the British Museum is a statue of the
deity IBIS, between two mummies. This attracted the attention of
Sibthorp, as he lounged through the room the other day with a
companion. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;is that
statue placed between the other two?&rdquo; &ldquo;To preserve it
to be sure,&rdquo; replied the keenly-witted Sib. &ldquo;You know

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JAMES DAWSON.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/009-12.png"><img src=

<p><span class="hide">M</span>ercy on us, what a code of
morality&mdash;what a conglomeration of plots (political, social,
and domestic)&mdash;what an exemplar of vice punished and virtue
rewarded&mdash;is the &ldquo;Newgate Calendar!&rdquo; and Newgate
itself! what tales might it not relate, if its stones could speak,
had its fetters the gift of tongues!</p>
<p>But these need not be so gifted: the proprietor of the Victoria
Theatre supplies the deficiency: the dramatic edition of Old-Bailey
experience he is bringing out on each successive Monday, will soon
be complete; and when it is, juvenile Jack Sheppards and incipient
Turpins may complete their education at the moderate charge of
sixpence per week. The &ldquo;intellectualization of the
people&rdquo; must not be neglected: the gallery of the Victoria
invites to its instructive benches the young, whose wicked parents
have neglected their education&mdash;the ignorant, who know nothing
of the science of highway robbery, or the more delicate operations
of picking pockets. National education is the sole aim of the sole
lessee&mdash;money is no object; but errand-boys and apprentices
<em>must</em> take their Monday night&rsquo;s lessons, even if they
rob the till. By this means an endless chain of subjects will be
woven, of which the Victoria itself supplies the links; the
&ldquo;Newgate Calendar&rdquo; will never be exhausted, and the
cause of morality and melodrama continue to run a triumphant
career!</p>
<p>The leaf of the &ldquo;Newgate Calendar&rdquo; torn out last
Monday for the delectation and instruction of the Victoria
audience, was the &ldquo;Life and Death of James Dawson,&rdquo; a
gentleman rebel, who was very properly hanged in 1746.</p>
<p>The arrangement of incidents in this piece was evidently an
appeal to the ingenuity of the audience&mdash;our own penetration
failed, however, in unravelling the plot. There was a drunken,
gaming, dissipated student of St. John&rsquo;s, Cambridge&mdash;a
friend in a slouched hat and an immense pair of jack-boots, and a
lady who delicately invites her lover (the hero) &ldquo;to a
private interview and a cold collation.&rdquo; There is something
about a five-hundred-pound note and a gambling-table&mdash;a heavy
throw of the dice, and a heavier speech on the vices of gaming, by
a likeness of the portrait of Dr. Dilworth that adorns the
spelling-books. The hero rushes off in a state of distraction, and
is followed by the jack-boots in pursuit; the enormous strides of
which leave the pursued but little chance, though he has got a good
start.</p>
<p>At another time two gentlemen appear in kilts, who pass their
time in a long dialogue, the purport of which we were unable to
catch, for they were conversing in stage-Scotch. A man then comes
forward bearing a clever resemblance to the figure-head of a
snuff-shop, and after a few words with about a dozen companions,
the entire body proceed to fight a battle; which is immediately
done behind the scenes, by four pistols, a crash, and the
double-drummer, whose combined efforts present us with a
representation of&mdash;as the bills kindly inform us&mdash;the
&ldquo;Battle of Culloden!&rdquo; The hero is taken prisoner; but
the villain is shot, and his jack-boots are cut off in their
prime.</p>
<p>James Dawson is not despatched so quickly; he takes a great deal
of dying,&mdash;the whole of the third act being occupied by that
inevitable operation. Newgate&mdash;a &ldquo;stock&rdquo; scene at
this theatre&mdash;an execution, a lady in black and a state of
derangement, a muffled drum, and a &ldquo;view of Kennington
Common,&rdquo; terminate the life of &ldquo;James Dawson,&rdquo;
who, we had the consolation to observe, from the apathy of the
audience, will not be put to the trouble of dying for more than
half-a-dozen nights longer.</p>
<p>Before the &ldquo;Syncretic Society&rdquo; publishes its next
octavo on the state of the Drama, it should send a deputation to
the Victoria. There they will observe the written and acted drama
in the lowest stage it is possible for even their imaginations to
conceive. Even &ldquo;Martinuzzi&rdquo; will bear comparison with
the &ldquo;Life and Death of James Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE BOARDING SCHOOL.</h3>
<p>At the &ldquo;Boarding School&rdquo; established by Mr. Bernard
in the Haymarket Theatre, young ladies are instructed in flirting
and romping, together with the use of the eyes, at the extremely
moderate charges of five and three shillings per lesson; those
being the prices of admission to the upper and lower departments of
Mr. Webster&rsquo;s academy, which is hired for the occasion by
that accomplished professor of punmanship Bayle Bernard. The course
of instruction was, on the opening of the seminary, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The lovely pupils were first seen returning from their morning
walk in double file, hearts beating and ribbons flying; for they
encountered at the door of the school three yeomanry officers. The
military being very civil, the eldest of the girls discharged a
volley of glances; and nothing could exceed the skill and precision
with which the ladies performed their eye-practice, the effects of
which were destructive enough to set the yeomanry in a complete
flame; and being thus primed and loaded for closer engagements with
their charming adversaries, they go off.</p>
<p>The scholars then proceed to their duties in the interior of the
academy, and we find them busily engaged in the study of &ldquo;The
Complete Loveletter <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name=
"page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>Writer.&rdquo; It is wonderful the
progress they make even in one lesson; the basis of it being a
<em>billet</em> each has received from the red-coats. The exercises
they have to write are answers to the notes, and were found, on
examination, to contain not a single error; thus proving the
astonishing efficacy of the Bernardian system of
&ldquo;Belles&rsquo; Lettres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the captain, by despatching his subalterns on special
duty, leaves himself a clear field, and sets a good copy in
strategetics, by disguising himself as a fruit-woman, and getting
into the play-ground, for the better distribution of apples and
glances, lollipops and kisses, hard-bake and squeezes of the hand.
The stratagem succeeds admirably; the enemy is fast giving way,
under the steady fire of shells (Spanish-nut) and kisses, thrown
with great precision amongst their ranks, when the lieutenant and
cornet of the troop cause a diversion by an open attack upon the
fortress; and having made a practicable breach (in their manners),
enter without the usual formulary of summoning the governess. She,
however, appears, surrounded by her staff, consisting of a teacher
and a page, and the engagement becomes general. In the end, the
yeomanry are routed with great loss&mdash;their hearts being made
prisoners by the senior students of this &ldquo;Royal Military
Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yeomanry, not in the least dispirited by this reverse, plan
a fresh attack, and hearing that reinforcements are <em>en
route</em>, in the persons of the drawing, dancing, and writing
masters of the &ldquo;Boarding School,&rdquo; cut off their march,
and obtain a second entrance into the enemy&rsquo;s camp, under
false colours; which their accomplishments enable them to do, for
the captain is a good penman, the lieutenant dances and plays the
fiddle, and the cornet draws to admiration,
especially&mdash;&ldquo;at a month.&rdquo; Under such instructors
the young ladies make great progress, the governess being absent to
see after the imaginary daughter of a fictitious Earl of Aldgate.
On her return, however, she finds her pupils in a state of great
insubordination, and suspecting the teachers to be incendiaries,
calls in a major of yeomanry (who, unlike the rest of his troop, is
an ally of the lady), to put them out. The invaders, however,
retreat by the window, but soon return by the door in their
uniform, to assist their major in quelling the fears of the minors,
and to complete the course of instruction pursued at the Haymarket
&ldquo;Boarding School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. J. Webster, as <em>Captain Harcourt</em>, played as well as
he could: and so did Mr. Webster as <em>Lieutenant Varley</em>,
which was very well indeed, for <em>he</em> cannot perform anything
badly, were he to try. An Irish cornet, in the mouth of Mr. F.
Vining, was bereft of his proper brogue; but this loss was the less
felt, as Mr. Gough personated the English Major with the
<em>rale</em> Tipperary tongue. <em>Mrs. Grosdenap</em> was a
perfect governess in the hands of Mrs. Clifford, and the hoydens
she presided over exhibited true specimens of a finishing school,
especially Miss P. Horton;&mdash;that careful and pleasing
<em>artiste</em>, who stamps character upon everything she does,
and individuality upon everything she says. In short, all the parts
in the &ldquo;Boarding School&rdquo; are so well acted, that one
cannot help regretting when it breaks up for the evening. The
circulars issued by its proprietors announce that it will be open
every night, from ten till eleven, up to the Christmas
holidays.</p>
<p>As a subject, this is a perfectly fair, nay, moral one; despite
some silly opinions that have stated to the contrary. Satire, when
based upon truth, is the highest province of the stage, which
enables us to laugh away folly and wickedness, when they cannot be
banished by direct exposure. Ladies&rsquo; boarding-schools form,
in the mass, a gross and fearful evil, to which the Haymarket
author has cleverly awakened attention. Why they are an evil, might
be easily proved, but a theatrical critique in PUNCH is not
precisely the place for a discussion on female education.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ENJOYMENT.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;Council of the Dramatic Authors&rsquo; Theatre&rdquo;
enticed us from home on Monday last, by promising what as yet they
have been unable to perform&mdash;&ldquo;Enjoyment.&rdquo; As
usual, they obtained our company under false pretences: for if any
&ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; were afforded by their new farce, the
actors had it all to themselves.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how vain some authors are of their knowledge
of any particular subject. Brewster monopolises that of the
polarization of light and kaleidoscopes&mdash;poor Davy surfeited
us with choke damps and the safety lantern&mdash;the author of
&ldquo;Enjoyment&rdquo; is great on the subject of cook-shops; the
whole production being, in fact, a dramatic lecture on the
&ldquo;slap-bang&rdquo; system. <em>Mr. Bang</em>, the principal
character, is the master of an eating-house, to which establishment
all the other persons in the piece belong, and all are made to
display the author&rsquo;s practical knowledge of the internal
economy of a cook-shop. Endless are the jokes about
sausages&mdash;roast and boiled beef are cut, and come to again,
for a great variety of faceti&aelig;&mdash;in short, the entire
stock of fun is cooked up from the bill of fare. The master gives
his instructions to his &ldquo;cutter&rdquo; about &ldquo;working
up the stale gravy&rdquo; with the utmost precision, and the
&ldquo;sarver out&rdquo; undergoes a course of instruction highly
edifying to inexperienced waiters.</p>
<p>This burletta helps to develop the plan which it is the
intention of the &ldquo;council&rdquo; to follow up in their
agonising efforts to resuscitate the expiring drama. They, it is
clear, mean to make the stage a vehicle for instruction.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau wrote a novel called &ldquo;Berkeley the
Banker,&rdquo; to teach political economy&mdash;the
&ldquo;council&rdquo; have produced &ldquo;Enjoyment&rdquo; as an
eating-house keepers&rsquo; manual, complete in one act. This mode
of dramatising the various guides to &ldquo;trade&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;service&rdquo; is, however, to our taste, more edifying than
amusing; for much of the author&rsquo;s learning is thrown away
upon the mass of audiences, who are only waiters between the acts.
They cannot appreciate the nice distinctions between
&ldquo;buttocks and rounds,&rdquo; neither does everybody perceive
the wit of <em>Joey&rsquo;s</em> elegant toast, &ldquo;Cheap beef
and two-pence for the waiter!&rdquo; This kind of
erudition&mdash;like that expended upon Chinese literature and the
arrow-headed hieroglyphics of Asia Minor&mdash;is confined to too
small a class of the public for extensive popularity, though it may
be highly amusing to the table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te and ham-and-beef
interest.</p>
<p>The chief beauty of the plot is its extreme simplicity; a
half-dozen words will describe it:&mdash;<em>Mr. Bang</em> goes out
for a day&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enjoyment,&rdquo; and is disappointed!
This is the head and front of the farceur&rsquo;s
offending&mdash;no more. Any person eminently gifted with patience,
and anxious to give it a fair trial, cannot have a better
opportunity of testing it than by spending a couple of hours in
seeing that single incident drag its slow length along, and
witnessing a new comedian, named Bass, roll his heavy breadth about
in hard-working attempts to be droll. As a specimen of manual
labour in comedy, we never saw the acting of this
<em>d&eacute;butant</em> equalled.</p>
<p>We are happy to find that, determined to give &ldquo;living
<em>English</em> dramatists a clear stage and fair play,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Council&rdquo; are bringing forward a series of stale
translations from the <em>French</em> in rapid succession. The
&ldquo;Married Rake,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Perfection,&rdquo;&mdash;one
by an author no longer &ldquo;living,&rdquo; both loans from the
<em>Magasin Th&eacute;&acirc;tral</em>&mdash;have already
appeared.</p>

<h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>
<h3>SUFFOLK-STREET GALLERY.&mdash;ART-UNION.</h3>
<p>The members of this institution have, with their usual
liberality, given the use of their Galleries for the exhibition of
the pictures selected by the prize-holders of the Art-Union of
London of the present year. The works chosen are 133 in number; and
as they are the representatives of &ldquo;charming variety,&rdquo;
it is naturally to be expected that, in most instances, the
selection does not proclaim that perfect knowledge of the material
from which the 133 jewel-hunters have had each an opportunity of
choosing; nevertheless, it is a blessed reflection, and a proof of
the philanthropic adaptation of society to societies&rsquo;
means&mdash;a beneficent dovetailing&mdash;an union of
sympathies&mdash;that to every one painter who is disabled from
darting suddenly into the excellencies of his profession, there
are, at least, one thousand &ldquo;connoisseurs&rdquo; having an
equal degree of free-hearted ignorance in the matter, willing to
extend a ready hand to his weakly efforts, and without whose
generosity he could never place himself within the observation and
patronage of the better informed in art. As this lottery was formed
to give an interest, indiscriminately, to the mass who compose it,
the setting apart so large a sum as &pound;300 for a prize is, in
our humble opinion, anything but well judged.</p>
<p>The painter of a picture worth so high a sum needs not the
assistance which the lottery affords; and although it may be urged,
that some one possessing sufficient taste, but insufficient means
to indulge that taste, might, perchance, obtain the high prize, it
is evident that such bald reasoning is adduced only to support
individual interest. The principle is, consequently, inimical to
those upon which the Art-Union of London was founded; and, farther,
it is most undeniable, that more general good, and consequent
satisfaction, would arise both to the painter and the public
(<em>i.e.</em> that portion of the public whose subscriptions form
the support of the undertaking), had the large prize been divided
into two, four, or even six other, and by no means inconsiderable
ones. We are fully aware of the benefits that have been conferred
and received, and that must still continue to be so, from this
praiseworthy undertaking. As an observer of these things, we cannot
withhold expressing our opinions upon any part of the system which,
in honest thought, appears imperfect, or not so happily directed as
it might be. But should PUNCH become prosy, his audience will
vanish.</p>
<p>To prevent those visitors to this exhibition, who do not profess
an intimacy with the objects herein collected for their amusement,
from being misled by the supposititious circumstance of the highest
prize having commanded the best picture, we beg to point to their
attention the following peculiarities (by no means recommendatory)
in the work selected by the most fortunate of the
<em>jewel-hunters</em>; it is catalogued &ldquo;The Sleeping
Beauty,&rdquo; by D. Maclise, R.A., and assuredly painted with the
most independent disdain for either law or reason. Never has been
seen so signal a failure in attempting to obtain repose by the
introduction of so many sleeping figures. The appointment of parts
to form the general whole, the first and last aim of every other
painter, D. Maclise, R.A., has most gallantly disregarded. If there
be effect, it certainly is not in the right place, or rather there
is no concentration of effect; it possesses the glare of a coloured
print, and that too of a meretricious sort&mdash;incidents there
are, but no plot&mdash;less effect upon the animate than the
inanimate. The toilet-table takes precedence of the lady&mdash;the
couch before the sleeper&mdash;the shadow, in fact, before the
substance; and as it is a sure mark of a vulgar mind to dwell upon
the trifles, and lose the substantial&mdash;to scan the dress, and
neglect the wearer, so we opine the capabilities of D. Maclise,
R.A., are brought into requisition to accommodate such beholders.
He has, moreover, carefully avoided any approximation to the
vulgarity of flesh and blood, in his representations of humanity;
and has, therefore, ingeniously sought the delicacy of Dresden
china for his models. To conclude our notice, we beg to suggest the
addition of a torch and a rosin-box, which, with the assistance of
Mr. Yates, or the Wizard of the North, would render it perfect
(whereas, without these delusive adjuncts, it is not recognisable
in its puppet-show propensities) as a first-rate imitation of the
last scene in a pantomime.</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
